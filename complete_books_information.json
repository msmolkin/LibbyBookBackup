You'll learn how to use this low risk method to beat the market and professional managers by a wide margin. You'll also learn how to view the stock market, why success eludes almost all individual and professional investors, and why the formula will continue to work even after everyone \"knows\" it.</p>",

Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band.

        "shortDescription": "The tenth and final year of the Trojan War comes to its climactic end in this infamous Greek epic. With the mighty Achilles brooding on the sidelines of the battle, the Greek army faces almost certain defeat. At the mercy of the intervening gods of Mount Olympus, the legendary warriors of Greece and Troy fight to the death in the name of honor, love, and vengeance. Originally written around 750 BCE, the authorship of this epic poem remains uncertain, but most scholars ascribe it to a blind Greek poet named Homer. William Cowper first published his translation in 1791; this unabridged edition comes from the work edited by Robert Southey, LL.D., with notes by M. A. Dwight, which was published in 1860.",

While sexually tame by today's standards, the book is memorable for better reasons-Lawrence's masterful and lyrical prose, and a vibrant story that takes us bodily into the world of its characters. As the novel opens, Constance Chatterley finds herself trapped in an unfulfilling marriage to a rich aristocrat whose war wounds have left him paralyzed and impotent. After a brief but unsatisfying affair with a playwright, Lady Chatterley enjoys an extremely passionate relationship with the gamekeeper on the family estate, Oliver Mellors. As Lady Chatterley falls in love and conceives a child with Mellors, she moves from the heartless, bloodless world of the intelligentsia and aristocracy into a vital and profound connection rooted in sexual fulfillment.

Through this novel, Lawrence attempted to revive in the human consciousness an awareness of savage sensuality, a sensuality with the power to free men and women from the enslaving sterility of modern technology and intellectualism. Perhaps even more relevant today than when it first appeared, Lady Chatterley's Lover is a triumph of passion and an erotic celebration of life.",

Although a large part is devoted to the mechanics of gaining and staying in power, Machiavelli's end purpose is to maintain a just and stable government. He is not ambiguous in stating his belief that committing a small cruelty to avert a larger is not only justifiable but required of a just ruler. Machiavelli gives a vivid portrayal of his world in the chaos and tumult of early-sixteenth-century Florence, Italy, and Europe. He uses both his contemporary political situation and that of the classical period to illustrate his precepts of statecraft.",

Behind them stand their gentler counterparts: Ashley Wilkes and Melanie Hamilton. As the lives and affairs of these absorbing characters play out against the tumult of the Civil War, Gone With the Wind reaches dramatic heights that have swept generations of fans off their feet. Having lived in Atlanta for many years, narrator Linda Stephens has an authentic ear for the dialects of that region. Get ready to hear Gone With the Wind exactly as it was written: every word beautifully captured in a spectacular unabridged audio production.",

Our inattention makes us constantly bounce between two extremes: during much of the day we live filled with the anxiety and pressures of our work and obligations, while during our leisure moments, we tend to live in passive boredom. The key, according to Csikszentmihalyi, is to challenge ourselves with tasks requiring a high degree of skill and commitment. Instead of watching television, play the piano.

Lewis offers a biting rebuke to this motley band of financial \" experts\" with keen research and a sharp pen.",

It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole. <br>Bestselling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a 90's kid by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and powering your house by destroying the fabric of space-time. And if you want to get rid of the book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapor, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the Earth's mantle, or launching it into the Sun. <br>By exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his readers. As he did so brilliantly in <i>What If?</i>, Munroe invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible.

If you want some lightweight edification, you won't go wrong with <i>How To</i>.&rdquo;<i> &mdash;</i>CNET</b><br> <br> <b><b>&ldquo;[<i>How To</i>] has science and jokes in it, so 10/10 can recommend.&rdquo;</b> <b><i>&mdash;Simone Giertz</i></b></b><br> <b><br>The world's most entertaining and useless self-help guide from the brilliant mind behind the wildly popular webcomic xkcd, the bestsellers <i>What If?</i> and <i>Thing Explainer</i>, and <i>What If? 2, </i>coming September 13, 2022</b><br>For any task you might want to do, there's a right way, a wrong way, and a way so monumentally complex, excessive, and inadvisable that no one would ever try it. <i>How To</i> is a guide to the third kind of approach. It's full of highly impractical advice for everything from landing a plane to digging a hole. <br>Bestselling author and cartoonist Randall Munroe explains how to predict the weather by analyzing the pixels of your Facebook photos. He teaches you how to tell if you're a baby boomer or a 90's kid by measuring the radioactivity of your teeth. He offers tips for taking a selfie with a telescope, crossing a river by boiling it, and powering your house by destroying the fabric of space-time. And if you want to get rid of the book once you're done with it, he walks you through your options for proper disposal, including dissolving it in the ocean, converting it to a vapor, using tectonic plates to subduct it into the Earth's mantle, or launching it into the Sun. <br>By exploring the most complicated ways to do simple tasks, Munroe doesn't just make things difficult for himself and his readers. As he did so brilliantly in <i>What If?</i>, Munroe invites us to explore the most absurd reaches of the possible. Full of clever infographics and fun illustrations, <i>How To</i> is a delightfully mind-bending way to better understand the science and technology underlying the things we do every day.",

The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br>&#160;<br>Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don&rsquo;t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;<br>&#160;<br>For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don&rsquo;t know, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, &ldquo;On Robustness and Fragility,&rdquo; which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world.<br>&#160;<br>Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, <i>The Black Swan</i> will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell.

We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the &ldquo;impossible.&rdquo;<br>&#160;<br>For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don&rsquo;t know, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, &ldquo;On Robustness and Fragility,&rdquo; which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world.<br>&#160;<br>Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, <i>The Black Swan</i> will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. <i>The Black Swan</i> is a landmark book&mdash;itself a black swan.<br>&#160;<br><b>Includes a bonus pdf of tables and figures.</b><br><b>Praise for Nassim Nicholas Taleb</b><br><b>&#160;</b><br>&ldquo;The most prophetic voice of all.&rdquo;<i><b>&mdash;GQ</b></i><br><b><i>&#160;</i></b><br><b>Praise for <i>The Black Swan</i></b><br>&#160;<br>&ldquo;[A book] that altered modern thinking.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;<i>The Times</i> (London)</b><br>&#160;<br>&ldquo;A masterpiece.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Chris Anderson, editor in chief of <i>Wired, </i>author of<i> The Long Tail</i></b><br><i>&#160;</i><br>&ldquo;Idiosyncratically brilliant.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Niall Ferguson, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></b><br><i>&#160;</i><br>&ldquo;<i>The Black Swan</i> changed my view of how the world works.&rdquo;<b>&mdash;Daniel Kahneman, Nobel laureate</b><br>&#160;<br>&ldquo;[Taleb writes] in a style that owes as much to Stephen Colbert as it does to Michel de Montaigne. . . .

As they search for the savage white whale, Ishmael questions all aspects of life.

In <I>Quirkology</I> , he navigates the backwaters of human behavior, discovering the tell-tale signs that give away a liar, the secret science behind speed-dating and personal ads, and what a person's sense of humor reveals about the innermost workings of their mind- all along paying tribute to others who have carried out similarly weird and wonderful work. Wiseman's research has involved secretly observing people as they go about their daily business, conducting unusual experiments in art exhibitions and music concerts, and even staging fake sainces in allegedly haunted buildings. With thousands of research subjects from all over the world, including enamored couples, unwitting pedestrians, and guileless dinner guests, Wiseman presents a fun, clever, and unexpected picture of the human mind.",
