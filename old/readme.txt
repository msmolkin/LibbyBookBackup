I'm not resetting the directory completely before uploading, for historical and moral reasons. You should be able to see my historical changes if you want to. I'm just going to delete the files that are no longer needed. The only downside is that I might have some exposed secrets in the history. I won't bother checking. If you find them, please do not hesitate to let me know by emailing msmolkin [at] ucdavis [dot] edu.
