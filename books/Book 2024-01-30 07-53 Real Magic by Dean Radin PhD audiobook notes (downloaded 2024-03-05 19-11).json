      "note": "So this brings up a good point. Maybe ‚Äúreal magic‚Äù and Kabbalah are an offshoot of this Neoplatonism, and Jewish and other mysticism spring from his imaginings (or, maybe it‚Äôs the opposite, of course I have to give the religion some credit, given that it‚Äôs the philosophy of a people that has survived many, many years and which included my ancestors and brought life to me)"

      "note": "Lol. The very things that would make you more susceptible to believe in crock. [these are the things that make it ‚Äúmore likely‚Äù for magic to occur. I.E. it‚Äôs more likely to happen and be reported by people who are more likely to believe in something that isn‚Äôt real, at a time when they are at a heightened state of sensitivity to this unreal sphere. Of course, this can be said another way, that people are ‚Äúmore likely to experience this magical realm when they're at a heightened state of sensitivity‚Äù; if you‚Äôre of the sort inclined to believe this is true, this is how you‚Äôd say it and it means roughly the same thing that I said above]"

      "note": "In true, traditional Judaism, Magic does exist. We shouldn't practice it, probably for fear of exactly what they're saying here, that people might turn away and it's easier to control people if they only believe what you want them to, but there's nothing inherently against magic. Kabbalah is essentially magic. The belief his neck, given the proper incantation and using the right words, you can essentially create anything. That's why names have such power. And God created the world in six days through speech"

It also means that, until you've been shown definitive proof, you can't accept something is true. Those two go hand-in-hand. So I have to remember that, when reading this book, I need to have bittul; I need to have an open mind"
