They allege two counts. One is a ‘substantive’ count of insider trading, meaning you actually made a trade they deem illegal, and the other is ‘conspiracy,’ a catch-all prosecutors use to try to entangle someone. It’s a very liberal, wide-net charge that covers an agreement between two or more people to potentially do something wrong",

As for applications, I should just (without putting much thought into it) apply. Fix up my resume (remove any negative aspects). Bring up some negative quality about myself at the beginning of an interview and talk to the interviewer about something interesting not related to the job throughout the course of the interview, and I should seem picture perfect aside from that little flaw at the beginning. Also make some mistake at the end of the interview so they like me (too perfect is bad), but without revealing any character flaws"
