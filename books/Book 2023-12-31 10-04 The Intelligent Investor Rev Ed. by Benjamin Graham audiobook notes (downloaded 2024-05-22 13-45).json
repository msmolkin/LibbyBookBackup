If we don't know when a certain part like this current one was written, and say it talks about how the market has changed fundamentally since some changes that occurred in 1949, then we don't know whether that's talking about last year, so he's saying changes since ‚Äújust now,‚Äù or whether 1949 is referring to 65 years ago, and he actually has a solid basis for what he‚Äôs saying here about a paradigm shift that occurred at the time. So, we really should just be referring to the original version of the book where everything is clear"
