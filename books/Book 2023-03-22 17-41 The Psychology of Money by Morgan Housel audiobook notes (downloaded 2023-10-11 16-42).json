For example, when adding more memory or transistors onto a chip, if you double the transistors or have size, then you double the amount. So you have to make sure that your investments all work this way. Instead of incremental, marginal growth, you want to ~~double~~ add N% every time you increase. So it compounds, growing exponentially rather than linearly."
